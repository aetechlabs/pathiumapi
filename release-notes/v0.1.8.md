### pathiumapi 0.1.8 — 2025-12-23

Added
- Pydantic integration helpers for easy request body validation via `@validate_body(Model)`.

Changed
- Improved release process documentation to discourage using `--force` with the release helper; prefer committing or cleaning the working tree before releasing.

Fixed
- Minor packaging metadata and egg-info consistency fixes applied during release preparation.

Developer notes:
- Added tests for Pydantic validation and included `pydantic>=1.10` as a development dependency.
- Created `feature/pydantic-validation` branch and merged into `main` with validation helpers and tests.
