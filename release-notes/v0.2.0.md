# v0.2.0 - 2025-12-24

### Highlights

- CLI: `pathiumapi generate route` now supports adding multiple HTTP method handlers
  into an existing `routes/<name>.py` module. This makes it easier to scaffold
  routes incrementally (e.g., add POST after you previously generated GET).

- Robust CLI/runtime imports: `pathiumapi run` logic was hardened and minor
  issues in the CLI were fixed.

- Optional auth dependency: `PyJWT` is no longer required to import `pathiumapi`.
  If `PyJWT` is missing, attempting to use auth helpers raises a clear
  RuntimeError instructing how to install it.

### Notes for maintainers

- Ensure `PyJWT` is listed as a dev dependency if you rely on auth-related tests or
  examples.

- The release prep included small test and README improvements.
