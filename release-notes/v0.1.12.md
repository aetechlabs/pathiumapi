# Release v0.1.12

Release highlights
------------------

- Improved documentation and onboarding:
  - Clarified Quickstart and CLI usage in the top-level README for PyPI visitors.
  - Expanded `usage.md` examples and added a beginner-friendly guide that shows
    how to run and inspect the interactive docs at `/docs`.

- OpenAPI & Pydantic enhancements:
  - Auto-generate OpenAPI component schemas from Pydantic models used for
    request bodies and query parameters.
  - Added `@validate_query` decorator which validates query parameters and
    exposes the parameter schema in `/openapi.json`.
  - Improved compatibility between Pydantic schema output and OpenAPI
    expectations (ensures `properties` and `required` keys are always present).

- Middleware & Auth:
  - Added and improved common middleware (CORS, security headers, simple
    in-memory rate limiter) and documented usage examples.
  - JWT authentication middleware and helpers included with an example
    (`examples/auth_app.py`).

- Tests & Examples:
  - Added tests and runnable examples demonstrating query-model OpenAPI
    generation (`tests/test_openapi_query.py`, `examples/query_app.py`).
  - Test suite passes locally; CI adjustments prepared for packaging and publish.

- Release process:
  - Release helper (`scripts/release.py`) used to create a clean, repeatable
    bump-and-tag flow. This release was prepared by the helper and release
    notes were added under `release-notes/`.
